# task-manager

Very simple todo application created with Vue.js. The App is hooked up to a Firebase backend, so all the tasks added are being stored to a cloud database.

This was created mainly for learning purposes. (Vue.js ROCKS btw)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
